# Quantum Computing and Quantum Networks


```
Welcome!

In our research group we explore quantum information science with trapped ions and optical cavities. 
Our research focuses on processing quantum information on a trapped-ion system 
and implementing network protocols in an ion-cavity quantum interface. 
We also aim to develop a scalable quantum computer via combining advantages of the trapped ions with those of the optical cavities.

## Research projects

* Quantum information with trapped ions
```
We carry out quantum computing and quantum simulation experiments with a string of ions confined in a linear Paul trap. We are interested in the following topics:

Robust control of the ions' internal and external degrees of freedom
Realization of high-fidelity quantum gates
Implementation of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms
Investigation of quantum many-body physics of a spin system

```
* Nanofabrication of quantum computing chips
```
We develop scalable quantum devices using state-of-the-art nanofabrication technologies. Our research group aims to fabricate and characterize:

Scalable ion-trapping chips
Superconducting qubits with long coherence times
CMOS-based quantum devices
Neuromorphic  semiconductor devices
```

* Ion-cavity quantum interface
```
The goal of this project is to develop an ion-based quantum network node with optical cavities. Planned research topics include:

Ion-photon entanglement at high fidelities
Reversible coherent state transfer between ions and photons
Implementation of quantum network protocols
Monitoring and stabilizing a qubit state via weak measurements
```
