# Quantum Computing and Quantum Networks


```
Welcome!

In our research group we explore quantum information science with trapped ions and optical cavities. 
Our research focuses on processing quantum information on a trapped-ion system 
and implementing network protocols in an ion-cavity quantum interface. 
We also aim to develop a scalable quantum computer via combining advantages of the trapped ions with those of the optical cavities.
